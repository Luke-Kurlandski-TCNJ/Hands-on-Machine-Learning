    "The main steps of any ML project are as follows:\n",
    "1. Look at the big picture\n",
    "2. Get the data\n",
    "3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights\n",
    "4. Prepare the data for ML algorithms\n",
    "5. Select a model and train it\n",
    "6. Fine-tune the model\n",
    "7. Present solution\n",
    "8. Launch, monitor, and maintain system\n",
    "\n",
    "See for an example concerning predicting house price: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb\n",
    "## Look at the Big Picture\n",
    "### Frame the Problem\n",
    "Pipeline - different ML algorithms producing data fed into a cumulative ML algorithm\n",
    "<br>Multiple Regression - using multiple features to make a prediction\n",
    "<br>Univariate Regression - predicting a single value\n",
    "<br>Multivariate Regression - predicting multiple values\n",
    "### Select a Performance Measure\n",
    "Root Mean Square Error - common performance measure\n",
    "Mean Absolute Error - performance error that is well suited for data with many outliers\n",
    "The above are both ways of measuring the distance between vectors.\n",
    "## Get the Data\n",
    "### Download the Data\n",
    "Consider using a function to automatically download latest version of data.\n",
    "### Take a Quick Look at Data Structure\n",
    "Observe data in pandas charts.\n",
    "<br>Create histograms (charts) for various features of the data.\n",
    "### Create a Test Set\n",
    "Set aside ~20% of data for test cases. \n",
    "<br>Ensure that the SAME ~80% of data is used to train the algorithm; do not mix test and training data.\n",
    "<br>Stratified Sampling - divide sample into homogeneuous subgroups, strata, and use a representative amount of each subgroup\n",
    "## Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights\n",
    "### Visualizing Geographic Data\n",
    "Different kinds of plots can clearly display important characteristics of data.\n",
    "### Looking for Correlations\n",
    "Standard Correlation Coefficient - value [-1, 1] that describes how strong the posotive/negative correlation is; nothing to do with slope\n",
    "<br>pandas.scatter_matrix plots every numerical value versus every numerical value.\n",
    "### Experimenting with Attribute Combinations\n",
    "Attributes can be combined in considerate ways to produce additional meaningful attributes.\n",
    "<br>For example, combine household income and people per household to understand how income in split up per person.\n",
    "## Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms\n",
    "### Data Cleaning\n",
    "Fixing data with missing features has three solutions: \n",
    "1. Get rid of the data elements missing the feature\n",
    "2. Get rid of the entire attribute\n",
    "3. Set a default feature value if missing, ex the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Text and Categorical Attributes\n",
    "ML algorithms work best with numerical values, not strings.\n",
    "<br>One-Hot Encoding - using a value of 1 (hot) or 0 (cold) to represent whether a piece of data fulfils a particular string property\n",
    "### Custom Transformers\n",
    "Create a custon Transform and implement the these three methods to promote duck typing with the other Scikit Transforms: fit, transform, fit_transform\n",
    "### Feature Scaling\n",
    "Feature Scaling - adjusting the numerical scale of features to improve algorithm efficiency\n",
    "<br>Min-Max Scaling - subtract min value, then divide by (max - min); results in values [0,1]\n",
    "<br>Standardization - subtract mean value, then divide by standard deviation; results in values that describe how many standard deviations away from mean\n",
    "### Transformation Pipelines\n",
    "Use Scikit pipeline to apply Transforms to all features sequentially\n",
    "## Select and Train a Model\n",
    "### Training and Evaluating on the Training Set\n",
    "A LinearRegression fit may badly underfit the data and a DecisionTreeRegressor may badly overfit the data.\n",
    "### Better Evaluation Using Cross-Validation\n",
    "Using Cross-Validation can reveal serious flaws in models.\n",
    "<br>In the end, RandomForestRegressor works best on this problem.\n",
    "<br>Try out several types of models before using hyperparameters.\n",
    "<br>Save models with joblib\n",
    "## Fine Tune Your Model\n",
    "### Grid Search\n",
    "Scikit's GridSearchCV can create Models with every combination of hyperparamters and select the best one.\n",
    "### Randomized Search\n",
    "When thousands of hyperparamters are available, RandomizedSearch can test an intelligent amount of random combinations of hyperparameters.\n",
    "### Ensemble Methods\n",
    "Ensemble Learning - building a model on top of other models.\n",
    "### Analyze the Best Models and Their Errors\n",
    "The model, like RandomForestRegressor, can display the relative importance of the features in an ordered list.\n",
    "### Evaluate Your System on the Test Set\n",
    "Do not tweak the model based upon the test set.\n",
    "## Launch, Monitor, and Maintain Your System\n",
    "An ML application must be automatically monitored for performance.\n",
    "<br>Models decay with time, regardless of the algorithm.\n",
    "<br>A good product must be able to be easily updated.\n",
    "<br>Several tasks can be automated: \n",
    "1. Collecting a labeling fresh data\n",
    "2. Training a new model and fine tuning hyperparamteters\n",
    "3. Evaluating new model and deploying if more effective than the old"
